# 💯 100 Days of Projects 🚀

Alright, buckle up buttercups! You've stumbled upon `100-days-of-projects`, my personal coding gauntlet, a daily dose of code-smashing goodness to keep those skills sharp and the creative juices flowing.

## 📝 Description

This repo is my self-imposed challenge: I'm whipping up a fresh, tiny frontend application *every single day* to seriously level up my coding skills. Think of it as a deep dive into vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, one project at a time. No fancy frameworks, just pure, unadulterated web dev fundamentals. It's all about consistency, learning, and having a blast while building cool stuff!

## 🛠️ Technologies

What's under the hood? Pretty much the holy trinity of web development, all served up vanilla-style:

*   **JavaScript:** The brainy one, handling all the logic and interactivity.
*   **CSS:** The one making everything look pretty and responsive.
*   **HTML:** The skeleton, structuring the content of each daily masterpiece.

No fancy frameworks, no massive libraries, just the good old browser APIs and core web tech. This challenge is all about mastering the basics!

## 🚀 Getting Started

Wanna poke around or run these projects yourself? It's easier than falling off a log!

1.  **Clone this repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/toko-stark/100-days-of-projects.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to any project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd 100-days-of-projects/01-RockPaperScissors
    ```
    (Replace `01-RockPaperScissors` with the project you want to check out!)
3.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Just drag and drop the `index.html` file into your favorite web browser, or right-click and "Open with Live Server" if you're rocking VS Code.
    ```bash
    # Example for opening in a browser (macOS)
    open index.html
    ```

And voilà! You're good to go.
